4. Now you will see the first page, which allow you to choose "single" or "multiplayer". As well as choosing the topic.

### "Note!!!" Gaming mode of "Multi-player" is not working yet at the current stage. We are looking for ways to implement it in the future.

5. Choose the topic you want under categories session. Default would be "Animals". Five topics are provided.

6. After selecting you preference category, click the "Start Game" button.

7. Now you are brought to the "gamepage.html", which is where you will be playing the game.

8. "Note!!!" You have only 6 lives!

### "Note!!!" If you are in mobile size, you have to enter alphabet one by one into the input field.

9. Any wrong letter chosen => -1 live! && the key selected before will not be able to select again, it color will be lighten.

10. Only the correct selection will appear on the line.

    else {you lose!};
